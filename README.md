CaptureKing
===========

CaptureKing 1.0, a Visual Basic 6.0, Windows XP project.
created by Christopher McKirgan

The project, executables and all accompanying source can be changed
without notification to me, but I would like to know for the fun of it. You
can find me at kirgy.co.uk. All I ask is that my name remains alongside
the source code to the original and any modifications of the project. 


You'll find a very nice user guide under the '/Guide' directory. This project
was original part of my A-level computing course at Bridgwater College,
England in 2008. As such, it is intended for windows XP and will 
REQUIRE the depreciated winsock control which may not be compatible
with other version of windows. (I havenâ€™t tested it, so I don't know if it is).

Other than that, you're free to buy, sell, modify, burn or wipe a bogey on
any part of the source here. Happy hacking.
